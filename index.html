				<p>After thirteen years together we have finally set the date to get married, the date being Saturday 16<sup>th</sup>August 2014.</p>

				<h2>The Engagement</h2>
			<p>We had been together for just over 4 years when I decided it was time to propose. First I had to make the most nerve racking phone call of my life, to Billy Lisa`s dad. I asked him for his daughters hand in marriage and he gave me his blessing</p>

			<p>
				I decided to cook Lisa her favourite meal. Accross the candle lit table I asked her for her hand. Guessing what was coming Lisa gave me her right hand! with a wicked smile. I got up, walked around the table and got down on one knee. I pulled the ring from my pocket, took her left hand and asked her to be my wife. Lisa, nodding managed to get out a 'yes' before bursting into tears. That was nearly nine years ago!! and now we are finally tying the knot.
